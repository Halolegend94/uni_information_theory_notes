\section{Lesson 1}

Information Theory is born from one man, Cloude Shannon (1926 - 2001); it has to do with probability, algebra, coding theory, ergodic theory and appears in daily life. In communication you want to be understood, but you also want to avoid redundancy and words tend to be lengthy; there is a conflict of interest. Why some words are short and others are long? Short words encode common abstract pictures whereas long words must carry the whole information not available in common knowledge [nessuna fonte].\\
